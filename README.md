# Passkey-Django

This is my thesis project.

## Overview

This project is a web application built with Django. It provides a platform for managing user authentication and authorization using passkeys.

## Installation

WARNING: Passkey sign-up is not implemented yet so to use passkey create a profile with username and password first. From there you can test otp functionality as well as passkeys.

1. clone this repository
2. highly suggested to create a virtuale enviroment, 'pipenv' was used during developement
3. if you have decided to use pipenv enter the virtual enviroment
         $ pipenv shell
4. install all required packages, they are stored in the requirements.txt file
         $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   
## Usage

1. start the server
         $ python manage.py runserver
2. to test it go to http://localhost:8000
         i know that tecnically localhost:8000 and 127.0.0.1:8000 are almost the same, 
         but localhost is recognised as a trusted source, 127.0.0.1:8000 is not and webauth features would not work
